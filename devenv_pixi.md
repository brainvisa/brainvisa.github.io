title: Development environment for BrainVISA 6
---

Installing a BrainVisa developer environment is now done using Pixi.
It consists in cloning [the soma-env repository from github](https://github.com/brainvisa/soma-env), starting a pixi shell in it, then running the `bv_maker` command.
The full instructions are there on the github repository:
https://github.com/brainvisa/soma-env

**Note** that the new stabilized branches are the `6.0` set of branches, which should be preferred (to `main`/`master`) unless reworking major changes in the libraries.
