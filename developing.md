title: developing in BrainVISA environment
---

Sources: currently partly on GitHub, partly on https://bioproj.extra.cea.fr/ using Subversion.

Developing and releasing toolboxes binary-compatible with core BrainVISA binary distributions: [casa-distro](https://brainvisa.info/casa-distro/index.html)

Downloading sources and building all the projects is handled by [brainvisa-cmake](https://brainvisa.info/brainvisa-cmake/), more precisely via the command [bv_maker](https://brainvisa.info/brainvisa-cmake/bv_maker.html) and a configuration file.
