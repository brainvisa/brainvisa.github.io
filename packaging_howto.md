# {{page.title}}

Conda packaging of brainvisa projects is based on the [soma-env](https://github.com/brainvisa/soma-env) project.
For maintenability purpose, two distinct branches of the brainvisa projects can be packaged :
* The stable branches (using soma-env version 6.0). It is used to release stable versions. Only minor fixes are done on these project branches.
* The development branches (using soma-env version 0.0). It is used to release latest developments. Unstable fixes or features can be integrated to development packages.

Publication of neuro-forge packages to [brainvisa.info](https://brainvisa.info) is managed using the [neuro-forge](https://github.com/neurospin/neuro-forge) project.

## Stable release packaging
When we want to perform a release and publish conda packages of a distribution, the following steps should be done:

* setup a soma-env-6.0 environment (cf https://github.com/brainvisa/soma-env) or use the one setup on rosette
```
	ssh a-sac-ns-brainvisa@rosette
	cd /home_local/a-sac-ns-brainvisa/bbi-daily/soma-env-6.0
```
* update sources and build software tree
```
	pixi run bv_maker
```
* build a version plan: create a version plan that determine which projects should be released in the distribution, which versions for them, and check if versions match source revisions (typically if the source code has changed since the previous release, then the version number must have changed also, or be changed before the release)
```
	pixi run soma-env version_plan
```
* apply version plan: update version in project files and commit in github projects
```
	pixi run soma-env apply_plan
```
* update sources and build software tree
```
	pixi run bv_maker
```
* create a packaging plan: create a packaging plan that determine which conda packages should be built and published to /drf/neuro-forge.
```
	pixi run soma-env packaging_plan --release
```
* apply packaging plan: build changed conda packages and publish packages to .
```
	pixi run soma-env apply_plan
```

* setup a neuro-forge environment (cf https://github.com/neurospin/neuro-forge) or use the one setup on rosette
```
	ssh a-sac-ns-brainvisa@rosette
	cd /home_local/a-sac-ns-brainvisa/bbi-daily/neuro-forge
```

* build conda packages index and publish packages to brainvisa.info.
```
	pixi run neuro-forge publish
```
	

## Development packaging
When we want to package and publish development conda packages, the following steps should be done:

* setup a soma-env-0.0 environment (cf https://github.com/brainvisa/soma-env) or use the one setup on rosette
```
	ssh a-sac-ns-brainvisa@rosette
	cd /home_local/a-sac-ns-brainvisa/bbi-daily/soma-env-0.0
```
* update sources and build software tree
```
	pixi run bv_maker
```
* create a packaging plan: create a packaging plan that determine which conda packages should be built and published to /drf/neuro-forge.
```
	pixi run soma-env packaging_plan --release
```
* apply packaging plan: build changed conda packages and publish packages to .
```
	pixi run soma-env apply_plan
```

* setup a neuro-forge environment (cf https://github.com/neurospin/neuro-forge) or use the one setup on rosette
```
	ssh a-sac-ns-brainvisa@rosette
	cd /home_local/a-sac-ns-brainvisa/bbi-daily/neuro-forge
```

* build conda packages index and publish packages to brainvisa.info.
```
	pixi run neuro-forge publish
```
