# BrainVISA users and developers communication

This project will host both user interactions via the [discussions](https://github.com/brainvisa/brainvisa.github.io/discussions) section,
and developers information.

## Users

Users should normally look first at the [BrainVISA web site](https://brainvisa.info).

Questions can be searched for or posted in the [discussions section](https://github.com/brainvisa/brainvisa.github.io/discussions). This is now the place to get support (it will replace the former [brainvisa forum](https://brainvisa.info/forum)).

## BrainVISA developers site

This project also holds docs for developers:
